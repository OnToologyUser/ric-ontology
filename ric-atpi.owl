That concept also covers the case in which an aeroplane took off but, for whatever reason, was subsequently forced to return to the airport of departure where its passengers were transferred to other flights, Aurora Sousa Rodríguez and Others v Air France SA, Judgment in Case C-83/10, 13/10/2011</rdfs:comment>
